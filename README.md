Transformer Implementation
This is a PyTorch implementation of the Transformer model, a neural network architecture designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, introduced in the paper "Attention is All You Need" by Vaswani et al.

Modules
LayerNormalization
A module implementing Layer Normalization with learnable parameters.
Model Overview
Modules
LayerNormalization: Implements Layer Normalization with learnable parameters.
FeedForwardBlock: Represents the feed-forward block within the transformer architecture.
InputEmbeddings: Manages input embeddings, including an embedding layer and scaling according to the model's dimension.
PositionalEncoding: Provides positional encoding for injecting positional information into input embeddings.
ResidualConnection: Implements residual connections with layer normalization.
MultiHeadAttentionBlock: Represents the multi-head self-attention mechanism.
EncoderBlock: Represents an encoder block in the transformer architecture.
Encoder: Comprises multiple encoder blocks, forming the complete encoder.
DecoderBlock: Represents a decoder block in the transformer architecture.
Decoder: Comprises multiple decoder blocks, forming the complete decoder.
ProjectionLayer: Represents the final projection layer that produces the output sequence.
Transformer: The main transformer model, consisting of an encoder, a decoder, and various embedding and positional encoding layers.
Usage
To use the transformer, create an instance using the build_transformer function, specifying vocabulary sizes, sequence lengths, and other hyperparameters. Then, use the encode and decode methods for forward passes through the encoder and decoder, respectively.

Adjust the input shapes, vocabulary sizes, and other parameters according to your specific task and dataset.

Training
Train the transformer model on your dataset by defining an appropriate loss function and optimizer. Consider using learning rate schedules and early stopping to improve training efficiency.
